<h3>Dew Point</h3>

<p>
    The dew point is the temperature at which dew will form as air is cooled.
    It's a better measure than humidity for how humid it feels as the value does
    not vary with the air temperature the way the relative humidity percentage
    does. A higher dew point indicates more moisture in the air and therefore
    more humid conditions.
